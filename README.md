## Why use Lithent?

### Lithent have the bare minimum of necessary functionality, with no unnecessary features.

Since 'react' and 'vue', there have been a lot of UI libraries coming out that boast full-stack functionality.

However, in the real world of development, there are times when you need to build something using only the bare minimum of key features, rather than a full-stack, full-featured library.

Lithent has implemented the bare minimum functionality needed to create and update virtual DOM in general (we only need to know 'render', 'mounter', 'updater', 'renewer', 'mountCallback', and 'updateCallback').

We provide code in the form of 'helpers' that extend the basic functionality, but using the helpers is only optional and talented users can extend and develop custom helpers for their own projects.

### Approach with the developer-friendly concept of closures between "component mounter" and "renderer"

Many existing UI libraries have their advantages, but they also create rules that are too strong and rigid for fear of users making mistakes.

JavaScript users are used to using closures and love to develop with them.

"Lithent" provides a familiar approach to my JavaScript development, as it leverages the properties of higher-order functions and closures to define and recycle the state of a component.

## Examples

- [More Examples](https://superlucky84.github.io/lithent/#examples)

```js
import { h, render, mount, Fragment } from 'lithent';
import { state } from 'lithent/helper';
import htm from 'htm';
const html = htm.bind(h);

const Component = mount((r, _props) => {
  const count = state(0, r);

  const change = () => (count.v += 1);

  // Updater
  return () => html`
    <${Fragment}>
      <li>count: ${count.v}</li>
      <button onClick=${change}>increase</button>
    <//>
  `;
});

// insertBefore
// render(`<${Component} />`, document.getElementById('root'), document.getElementById('nextElement'));

// appendChild
render(html`<${Component} />`, document.getElementById('root'));
```
