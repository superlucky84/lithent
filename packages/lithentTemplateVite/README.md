# Lithent Template Vite Plugin

Experimental Vite plugin that finds JSX sections in Lithent projects and compiles embedded template syntax to `h()` calls by delegating to `@lithent/lithent-template-parser`.

> ⚠️ The implementation is only a scaffold right now and will be expanded in subsequent steps.
